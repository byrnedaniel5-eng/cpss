"""High-level workflow for the true Shah & Samworth (2013) r-concave ElasticNet
stability selection pipeline.

Uses the r-concave bound (equation 8) for threshold derivation instead of the
Meinshausen & Buhlmann worst-case bound. Collects preprocessing and run
provenance into the returned results dict so save_results / write_run_manifest
can serialise it.
